The GSS has used a panel format previously, as parts of the 2006-2014 GSS. In the 2016-2020 GSS Panel, variables only contain data from one of the three years. To differentiate between versions of each variable, they have been appended with suffixes. Variables from 2016 (Wave 1a) have _1a appended, variables from 2018 (Wave 1b) have _1b appended, and variables from 2020 (Wave 2) have _2 appended. Users can also track cases from 2016 and 2018, and reinterviews from 2020 with the variable `samptype`.
