## Installation

`gssr` is a data package, bundling several datasets into a convenient format. The relatively large size of the data in the package means it is not suitable for hosting on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), the core R package repository. There are two ways to install it.

### Install direct from GitHub

You can install the beta version of gssr from [GitHub](https://github.com/kjhealy/gssr) with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("kjhealy/gssr")
```

### Installation using `drat`

While using `install_github()` works just fine, it would be nicer to be able to just type `install.packages("gssr")` or `update.packages("gssr")` in the ordinary way. We can do this using Dirk Eddelbuettel's [drat](http://eddelbuettel.github.io/drat/DratForPackageUsers.html) package. Drat provides a convenient way to make R aware of package repositories other than CRAN.

First, install `drat`:

```{r drat, eval = FALSE}
if (!require("drat")) {
    install.packages("drat")
    library("drat")
}
```

Then use `drat` to tell R about the repository where `gssr` is hosted:

```{r drat-gssr}
drat::addRepo("kjhealy")
```

You can now install `gssr`:

```{r gssr-drat, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("gssr")
```

To ensure that the `gssr` repository is always available, you can add the following line to your `.Rprofile` or `.Rprofile.site` file:

```{r rprofile}
drat::addRepo("kjhealy")
```

With that in place you'll be able to do `install.packages("gssr")` or `update.packages("gssr")` and have everything work as you'd expect. 

Note that the drat repository only contains data packages that are not on CRAN, so you will never be in danger of grabbing the wrong version of any other package.

## Loading the data

```{r load}
library(gssr)
```

### Single GSS years

You can quickly get the data for any single GSS year by using `gss_get_yr()` to download the data file from NORC and put it directly into a tibble.

```{r oneyear}
gss18 <- gss_get_yr(2018)

gss18
```


### The Cumulative Data File

The GSS cumulative data file is large. It is not loaded by default when you invoke the package. (That is, `gssr` does not use R's "lazy loading" facility. The data file is too big to do this without error.) To load one of the datasets, first load the library and then use `data()` to make the data available. For example, load the cumulative GSS file like this:

```{r all}
data(gss_all)
```

This will take a moment. Once it is ready, the `gss_all` object is available to use in the usual way:

```{r peek}
gss_all
```

The variables are documented in two supplementary tibbles, `gss_doc` and `gss_dict`. To load `gss_doc`, do this:

```{r load-doc}
data(gss_doc)
gss_doc
```

You can take a look at information on a particular variable by doing something like this:

```{r varlook}

gss_doc %>% filter(id == "race") %>% 
  select(id, description, text)

```

To look at a variable's marginals or its properties, use `unnest()`:

```{r marginals}

gss_doc %>% filter(id == "race") %>%
  select(marginals) %>% 
  unnest(cols = c(marginals))

```


```{r properties}

gss_doc %>% filter(id == "race") %>%
    select(properties) %>%
    unnest(cols = c(properties))

```

There are convenience functions to do this as well, for one or more categorical variables. One for the marginals:

```{r getfnex}
gss_get_marginals(varnames = c("race", "sex"))
```

And one for the properties:

```{r getfnex2}
gss_get_props(varnames = c("race", "sex"))
```

The package also comes with `gss_dict`, a tibble with similar information in a slightly different format:

```{r gssdict1}
data(gss_dict)
gss_dict
```


## Which questions were asked in which years?

We often want to know which years a question or group of questions was asked. We can find this out for one or more variables with `gss_which_years()`.

```r
gss_which_years(gss_all, fefam)

#> # A tibble: 33 x 2
#>     year fefam
#>    <dbl> <lgl>
#>  1  1972 FALSE
#>  2  1973 FALSE
#>  3  1974 FALSE
#>  4  1975 FALSE
#>  5  1976 FALSE
#>  6  1977 TRUE 
#>  7  1978 FALSE
#>  8  1980 FALSE
#>  9  1982 FALSE
#> 10  1983 FALSE
#> # â€¦ with 22 more rows
  
```

When querying more than one variable, use `c()`:

```r
gss_all %>%
  gss_which_years(c(industry, indus80, wrkgovt, commute)) %>%
  print(n = Inf)

#> # A tibble: 33 x 5
#>     year industry indus80 wrkgovt commute
#>    <dbl> <lgl>    <lgl>   <lgl>   <lgl>  
#>  1  1972 TRUE     FALSE   FALSE   FALSE  
#>  2  1973 TRUE     FALSE   FALSE   FALSE  
#>  3  1974 TRUE     FALSE   FALSE   FALSE  
#>  4  1975 TRUE     FALSE   FALSE   FALSE  
#>  5  1976 TRUE     FALSE   FALSE   FALSE  
#>  6  1977 TRUE     FALSE   FALSE   FALSE  
#>  7  1978 TRUE     FALSE   FALSE   FALSE  
#>  8  1980 TRUE     FALSE   FALSE   FALSE  
#>  9  1982 TRUE     FALSE   FALSE   FALSE  
#> 10  1983 TRUE     FALSE   FALSE   FALSE  
#> 11  1984 TRUE     FALSE   FALSE   FALSE  
#> 12  1985 TRUE     FALSE   TRUE    FALSE  
#> 13  1986 TRUE     FALSE   TRUE    TRUE   
#> 14  1987 TRUE     FALSE   FALSE   FALSE  
#> 15  1988 TRUE     TRUE    FALSE   FALSE  
#> 16  1989 TRUE     TRUE    FALSE   FALSE  
#> 17  1990 TRUE     TRUE    FALSE   FALSE  
#> 18  1991 FALSE    TRUE    FALSE   FALSE  
#> 19  1993 FALSE    TRUE    FALSE   FALSE  
#> 20  1994 FALSE    TRUE    FALSE   FALSE  
#> 21  1996 FALSE    TRUE    FALSE   FALSE  
#> 22  1998 FALSE    TRUE    FALSE   FALSE  
#> 23  2000 FALSE    TRUE    TRUE    FALSE  
#> 24  2002 FALSE    TRUE    TRUE    FALSE  
#> 25  2004 FALSE    TRUE    TRUE    FALSE  
#> 26  2006 FALSE    TRUE    TRUE    FALSE  
#> 27  2008 FALSE    TRUE    TRUE    FALSE  
#> 28  2010 FALSE    TRUE    TRUE    FALSE  
#> 29  2012 FALSE    FALSE   TRUE    FALSE  
#> 30  2014 FALSE    FALSE   TRUE    FALSE  
#> 31  2016 FALSE    FALSE   TRUE    FALSE  
#> 32  2018 FALSE    FALSE   TRUE    FALSE  
#> 33  2021 FALSE    FALSE   TRUE    FALSE

## The GSS and COVID-19

The GSS administrators have released a [Methodological Primer](https://gss.norc.org/Documents/other/2021%20XSEC%20R1%20Methodological%20Primer.pdf) along with the [Documentation and Codebook for the 2021 survey](https://gss.norc.org/Documents/codebook/GSS%202021%20Codebook%20R1.pdf) that users should read carefully in connection with the effects of COVID-19 on data collection for the GSS.

The Primer notes:

> Since its inception, the GSS has conducted data collection via in-person interviews as its primary mode of data collection. The pandemic forced the GSS to change this design, moving from in-person to address- based sampling and a push-to-web methodology, with the bulk of the interview conducted online via a self- administered questionnaire.


In addition, 

> We recommend our users include the one of the following statements when reporting on the GSS 2021 Cross-section data: _Total Survey Error Summary Perspective for the 2021 GSS Cross-section:_ Changes in opinions, attitudes, and behaviors observed in 2021 relative to historical trends may be due to actual change in concept over time and/or may have resulted from methodological changes made to the survey methodology during the COVID-19 global pandemic.

And, 

> _Suggested Statement to Include in Articles and Reports That Use GSS Data:_ To safeguard the health of staff and respondents during the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021 GSS data collection used a mail-to-web methodology instead of its traditional in-person interviews. Research and interpretation done using the data should take extra care to ensure the analysis reflects actual changes in public opinion and is not unduly influenced by the change in data collection methods. For more information on the 2021 GSS methodology and its implications, please visit https://gss.norc.org/Get-The-Data

## Panel data

In addition to the Cumulative Data File, the gssr package also includes the GSS's panel data. The current rotating panel design began in 2006. A panel of respondents were interviewed that year and followed up on for further interviews in 2008 and 2010. A second panel was interviewed beginning in 2008, and was followed up on for further interviews in 2010 and 2012. And a third panel began in 2010, with follow-up interviews in 2012 and 2014. The `gssr` package provides three datasets, one for each of three-wave panels. They are `gss_panel06_long`, `gss_panel08_long`, and `gss_panel10_long`.  The datasets are provided by the GSS in wide format but (as their names suggest) they are packaged here in long format. The conversion was carried out using the [`panelr` package](https://panelr.jacob-long.com) and its `long_panel()` function. Conversion from long back to wide format is possible with the tools provided in `panelr`.

The panel data objects must be loaded in the same way as the cumulative data file.

```{r panel}
data("gss_panel06_long")

gss_panel06_long
```

Although the panel data objects were created by `panelr`, they are regular tibbles. You do not need to use `panelr` to work with the data.

The column names in long format do not have wave identifiers. Rather,  `firstid` and `wave` variables track the cases. The `firstid` variable is unique for every respondent in the panel and has no missing values. The `wave` variable indexes responses from a given `firstid` panelist in each wave (if observed). The `id` variable is from the GSS and indexes individuals within waves.

```{r panel-example}
data("gss_panel08_long")

gss_panel08_long %>% 
  select(firstid, wave, id, sex)
```

We can look at attrition across waves with, e.g.:

```{r attrition}
gss_panel06_long %>% 
  select(wave, id) %>%
  group_by(wave) %>%
  summarize(observed = n_distinct(id),
            missing = sum(is.na(id)))
```

The documentation tibble for the panel data is called `gss_panel_doc`.

```{r paneldoc}
data("gss_panel_doc")

gss_panel_doc
```

Each row is a variable. The `id`, `description`, and `text` columns provide the details on each question or measure. The `properties` and `marginals` are provided in the remaining columns, with a suffix indicating the wave. The categorical variables in the panel codebook can be queried in the same way as those in the cumulative codebook. We specify that we want to look at `gss_panel_doc` rather than `gss_doc` and we say which property wave or marginals wave we want to see.

```{r paneldocfun}
gss_get_marginals(varnames = c("sex", "race"), data = gss_panel_doc, margin = marginals_2)


gss_get_marginals(varnames = "padeg", data = gss_panel_doc, margin = marginals_1)
```

## Further details

The package is documented at <http://kjhealy.github.io/gssr/>. The GSS homepage is at <http://gss.norc.org/>. While the `gssr` package incorporates the publicly-available GSS cumulative data file, the package is not associated with or endorsed by the National Opinion Research Center or the General Social Survey.
