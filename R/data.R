#' General Social Survey Survey 2020 Panel Data
#'
#' A tibble containing the General Social Survey 2020 Panel Data
#' File, in wide format.
#'
#' @format A tibble with 5,215  rows and 4,296 columns. Variables are encoded as labelled vectors.
#'     The GSS Codebook is the authoritative source for the
#'     variables in this dataset. It is available at
#'     <http://gss.norc.org/Get-Documentation>. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
#'     in 2020 the conducted the GSS was conducted as two studies: (1) a panel re-interview of past
#'     respondents from the 2016 and 2018 cross sectional GSS studies (referred to as the 2016-2020
#'     GSS Panel), and (2) an independent fresh cross-sectional address-based sampling push to web
#'     study (referred to as 2020 cross-sectional survey). This data object is for the first study;
#'     namely, the study empaneling former 2016 and 2018 GSS respondents to answer a GSS
#'     questionnaire in 2020 (i.e., the 2016-2020 GSS panel).
#'
#'     This data focuses on Wave 2 of the 2016-2020 GSS Panel â€“ i.e. the panel reinterviews with 2018 GSS
#'     respondents and a randomly selected subset of 2016 GSS respondents. The GSS has used a panel format
#'     previously, as parts of the 2006-2014 GSS. In the 2016-2020 GSS Panel, variables only
#'     contain data from one of the three years. To differentiate between versions of each variable,
#'     they have been appended with suffixes. Variables from 2016 (Wave 1a) have _1a
#'     appended, variables from 2018 (Wave 1b) have _1b appended, and variables from 2020 (Wave 2) have _2
#'     appended. Users can also track cases from 2016 and 2018, and reinterviews from 2020 with the variable
#'     `samptype`.
#'
#'     Because of its relatively complex nature, users are strongly encouraged to consult the
#'     official [GSS documentation for this dataset](https://gss.norc.org/Documents/codebook/2016-2020%20GSS%20Panel%20Codebook%20-%20R1a.pdf).
